generate_flit_trace.py ---> flit_trace.txt			packet length = N
generate_flit_trace_v2.py ---> flit_trace_v2.txt	packet length = 1
generate_flit_trace_v3.py ---> flit_trace_v3.txt	injection timing is totally independent from tensor timestamp -- only sequence kept
generate_flit_trace_v4.py ---> flit_trace_v4.txt	flits are injected in parallel from different sources
